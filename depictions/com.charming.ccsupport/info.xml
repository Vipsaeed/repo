		<description>Support tweak for CC modules!
			Compatible with iOS 11, 12 and 13

			CCSupport adds the ability for other developers to add their own modules to the Control Center.
			It does so in a safe way to ensure that the Control Center does not get messed up when the tweak is not loaded.

			It also serves as a standalone tweak, because it unlocks the otherwise fixed modules to be moved in settings.
			This includes the connectivity module, the media controls module, the brightness and volume slider modules and the AirPlay module.
			Icons and names for these modules have been recreated, to ensure a stock look.

			There also is a feature to reset the module layout for both configurations (tweak loaded, tweak not loaded).
			The button to do that can be found at the bottom of the Control Center settings page.</description>
